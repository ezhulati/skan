# Legacy Cloud Functions (Deprecated)

This directory contains the original Firebase Functions build that powered the early Skan.al prototype. It is no longer maintained.

- **Do not deploy from here.** Use `skan-ecosystem/functions` for all active development, testing, and deployments.
- The code remains for historical reference only. If you need to compare old behavior, read files directly but avoid modifying them.
- New scripts, environment variables, and CI jobs should always target the `skan-ecosystem/functions` package.

> If you find yourself editing this folder, pause and confirm that the change really belongs in the legacy stack.
